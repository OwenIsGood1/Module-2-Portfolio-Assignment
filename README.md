# Module-2-Portfolio-Assignment
Module 2 Lab - Homepages Index Page:  Your IT2040 Portfolio 
 
This week we'll replace the index.html file that we worked on last week.  We'll start adding basic HTML and CSS to structure and format the webpage.  
 
Before starting this lab, you should already be comfortable uploading files to homepages.uc.edu and creating the link to view your web page.  If you are not, you must reach out to your instructor, TA, or a classmate ASAP. If your instructor canâ€™t view your web page using the link you submit, you will receive a zero for the assignment.  It is your responsibility to make sure you seek assistance if you are struggling.  If you did not pass last week's lab you will be awarded credit for it when you successfully complete this lab.  You may resubmit this lab during the next week, until you pass.  This lab is also pass/fail.  There is no partial credit, it must be done 100% correctly.
